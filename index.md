## About
I am now a first-year Ph.D. candidate at the College of Artificial Intelligence of Beijing Normal University. My current research is in the area of zero-knowledge proofs and privacy preservation. Before I started pursuing my Ph.D., I was a post-graduate student at Beijing Normal University, and my research region is image inpainting, a branch of computer vision and deep learning. Because of this background, I am interested in the privacy issue in machine learning and deep learning.
