## About
I am now a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. Xiaohua Jia. I have a broad research interest in the area of zero-knowledge proofs, privacy-preserving approaches, and trustworthy AI. I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in 2018 and Doctor's Degree in 2024 from the School of Artificial Intelligence of Beijing Normal University. Prior to the RAP in CityU, I was a Postdoc Research Fellow in the Lab for AI-Powered FINTECH in Hong Kong.
